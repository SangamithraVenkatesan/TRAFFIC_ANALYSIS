# Traffic Analysis Project

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing traffic patterns using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The project leverages a dataset of road traffic accident (RTA) statistics to identify patterns and derive insights. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files in the Repository

- **TRAFFIC_ANALYSIS.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models.
- **RTA Dataset.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook

## Required Libraries
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored as RTA Dataset.csv. It contains various attributes related to road traffic accidents.

## Results
The analysis includes:
Descriptive statistics and visualizations of traffic accident trends.
Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.
